## Important Notes/Assumption
- Dataset used ... 
- DATA and OUTPUT (results) folders not stored in this repository. Thus, to run the code, DATA and OUTPUT folders are to be added at 
```
   [your working Folder]
   ├── DATA                                 <- Store Data
   ├── OUTPUT                               <- Output directory for any results from the git repository
   ├── this git repository                  <- Implementation and Experiment Script of this project 
```

## This Project CODE 
```
    .
    ├── folder1                             <- description of the folder 
    ├── folder2                             <- description of the folder 
    │   ├── subfolder                       <- description of the sub folder 
    │   │   ├── sub-subfolder1       	<- description of the sub-sub folder 
    │   │   └── sub-subfolder2      		<- description of the sub-sub folder

```

```

2. Place Datasets [Datasetlink -- from Ms.Team](google.com) into /Data

3. Ensure `PYTHONPATH` points to current working directory
